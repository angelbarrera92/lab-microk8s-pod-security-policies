# 0. Save default kubeconfig

We will save the `microk8s` configuration file that allows us to interact with the kubernetes API. This configuration will use the insecure endpoint of the api. So you have to be very careful as it will not validate any security policy. We will only use this configuration file to perform requirements tasks of cluster configuration.

To save/generate this configuration file:

```bash
$ microk8s.config > .kube-insecure
$ cat .kube-insecure
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: http://:8080
  name: microk8s-cluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: microk8s-cluster
    user: admin
  name: microk8s
current-context: microk8s
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: admin
  user:
    username: admin
```

Let's configure this file as `kubectl` client configuration:

```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/.kube-insecure
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME     STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
pc1282   Ready    <none>   33s   v1.13.2
```
